Mathematical Modeling and Visualization Projects

This collection of Python scripts demonstrates various applications of mathematical modeling and visualization techniques,
including polar plots, interaction potentials, and the analysis of HIV patient data. Each script addresses a specific problem,
providing insights through numerical computations and graphical representations.


SCRIPT  DESCRIPTIONS

1. Spiral Plotting
_*P1a_Neira.py: Generates an Archimedean spiral (r=a+b theta) with a=0 and b=2
-*P1b_Neira.py: Creates a logarithmic spiral (r=a^theta) with a=0.8
Illustrates differences between Archimedean and logarithmic spirals.

2. Interaction Potentials
_*P2a_Neira.py: Analyzes and plots the Lennard-Jones potential and force, with and without Boltzmann normalization.
-*P2b_Neira.py: Investigates the equilibrium point for molecular interactions, using harmonic oscillators for fine adjustments

3.HIV Patient Data Analysis
-* P3a_Neira.py: Models HIV cell concentration in a patient using predefined parameters.
-* P3b_Neira.py: Explores parameter variations (alpha  and  Betta) to analyze their impact on cell concentration dynamics.
-* P3c_Neira.py: Automatically selects parameters based on error minimization (<20%) between model and data.

HOW TO USE 
Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, random.
