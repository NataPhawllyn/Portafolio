Family Savings Calculator
This project, titled Family Savings Calculator, calculates the total savings for the Neira family for a specific month by collecting their income and expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface to input values and displays the computed results.

Features
-*Income Input: Allows the user to input multiple income entries for the family.
-*Expense Input: Collects multiple expense entries for accurate calculations.
-*Savings Calculation: Computes the total savings as the difference between total income and total expenses.
-*Summary Display: Displays the final income, expenses, and computed savings.

Code Structure
1. Classes
-*FliaNeira (Family Neira)

Represents the familyâ€™s financial details with attributes for income, expenses, and savings.
Includes methods for setting and retrieving values (set and get methods).
Implements the method gananciaTotal to compute savings as income - expenses.
Overrides toString to display a summary of financial data.

-*Main

The main class orchestrates user input and calculations.
Uses a Scanner to collect income and expense data in a loop.
Displays the final results using the toString method of FliaNeira.

2. Key Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-*Encapsulation: Private attributes in FliaNeira are accessed through getter and setter methods.
-*Modularization: Responsibilities are divided between FliaNeira (data handling) and Main (logic and interaction).

Control Structures

-*Loops (for) are used to iteratively collect income and expense data.
-*Basic arithmetic operations are performed to compute savings.

User Interaction

-*Prompts the user to input data interactively via the console.

Build Tool

-*The project uses Apache Maven for build and dependency management.
