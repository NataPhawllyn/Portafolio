Finite Difference Method (FDM) - Solving the Wave Equation

This Python script implements the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to numerically solve a 1D wave equation.
The solution is visualized as a heatmap, showcasing the evolution of the wave over time and space.

Funtions 

FDM(dx, dt, N, J): Numerically solves the wave equation using central difference schemes for time and space.
grafica(U, Tfinal): Visualizes the numerical solution as a heatmap.

HOW TO RUN 
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, numba.
